Simple utility I wrote for my Discrete Math course (re. Graph Theory Project)

This utility will read a Snapchat Data Download and give you an interactive view and
statistics of the people you have talked to / snapped with (and give a detailed breakdown of such).

Code reuse is rampant ... as this is a simple hack thrown together in a few hours.
